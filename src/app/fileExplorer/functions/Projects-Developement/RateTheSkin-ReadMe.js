                Written in vanilla HTML and Javascript, RateTheSkin was designed to replicate a basic terminal. The User is able to type in a command (gun type). Then a loadup animation appears and they get taken to an old gui where they are able to rate csgo skins between 1 and 10. They are able to Download their final results as a tierlist png
